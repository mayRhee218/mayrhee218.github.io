## [UX/UI] Osulloc Mobile app renewal üçµ

![cover](/assets/img/pages/2025-09-01-design-projects/osulloc/cover.png)

This project was created through a **UX/UI study**, where I learned **UX methodologies** and **UI design techniques**.
I tried renewing the **mobile app of Osulloc**, a **representative Korean tea brand**.
