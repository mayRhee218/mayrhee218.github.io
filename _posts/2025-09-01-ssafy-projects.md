`Big Data-based Dental Insurance Recommendation Service`


**Chi Chu** is a big data-based dental insurance recommendation service that provides fast and accurate suggestions using 370,000+ insurance contract records.

The name "Chi Chu" is derived from the Korean words for **"Chi-A" (tooth) and "Chu-Cheon" (recommendation)**, representing a service that recommends dental insurance.

This system is based on the Sample Personal Credit Information DB (**50,000 users**) provided by the Korea Credit Information Services, the system recommends insurance plans based on age, gender, insurance category, desired monthly payment, coverage details, and benefit amounts.

We used python `Pandas` libary for analysing the big data, and made the website with `React, TypeScript, Recoil, Django, mySQL`. 

I was the `team leader` and `PM` who did scheduling and allocated workload. 
Also, I participated in `data analysing with pandas` and made web page 
with `React` as one of the two `frontend developers`.

`3D Metaverse Event Hall for SSAFY Members`

**SSAFY Meetup** is an event where SSAFY members from all over the country gather to enjoy together. However, due to the worsening COVID-19 situation, the meetup event, which used to be held offline, has been changed to a non-face-to-face format through **YouTube live streaming**.

We thought this current meeting via Youtube live streaming is **difficult to observe the various reactions of the trainees** and the **interactions are lacking**, which reduces immersion in the event. So we made **the metaverse meeting room** to reinfoce **interactions and immersion** in the event.

In this metaverse world, users could **interact** each other with **chat, avatar's motions and voice**.
Users could play mini games(O/X game, treasutr hunt...) and take photo in the photo zone.

We used `Unity, Photon PUN, OpeVidu` for making the interactive metaverse world and made it view on website using `React, Spring boot`.

My role was making the `Treasure Hunter` mini game in the Unity.
I made the UI and animation for the game with `C#`, and made timer which could be shared to all users with `Photon PUN`. Also I used `JsonUtility` class for parsing the JSON data to implement the feature of ranking of treasure hunt.
