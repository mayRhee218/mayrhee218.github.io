## May Rhee

Hi, I'm May.  
I like to **create visual things with code**.  

I am currently studying **Computer Science** at the Australian National University.  
Before coming to Australia, I worked as a **frontend web developer** in South Korea.  

I enjoy reading books (both related to software and not) and drawing.  
I also like meeting people, as well as learning and teaching new things.
